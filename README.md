WORK IN PROGRESS

The aim of this project is to build a chess web app in Spring Boot, allowing for cross-network play, storing results in an SQL databse, and eventually implementing a miniMax algorithm to evaluate positions and provide a bot to play against.

The current roadmap is:

1) DONE - Implement game in java: 2 weeks
2) Convert into web app with Spring Boot: 1 week
3) Automate testing: <1 week
4) Use WebSocket to communicate moves between two clients: <1 week
5) Store game results in a MySQL database (local as it's free): 1 day
6) Build GUI in React.js: 1 week
7) Implement miniMax algorithm < 1 week
8) Wrap in a Docker container for ease of deployment: 1 day
