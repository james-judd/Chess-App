WORK IN PROGRESS

The aim of this project is to build a chess web app in Java EE 8, allowing for cross-network play and eventually implementing a miniMax algorithm to evaluate positions and provide a bot to play against.

The current roadmap is:

1) DONE - Implement game in java: 2 weeks
2) Automate testing: < 1 week
3) Build GUI with Swing: 1 week
4) Convert into web app with Webswing: 1 day
5) Use WebSocket to communicate moves between two clients: 1 week
6) Store game results in a MySQL database (local as it's free): 1 day
7) Implement miniMax algorithm < 1 week
8) Wrap in a Docker container for ease of deployment: 1 day
