WORK IN PROGRESS

The aim of this project is to build a chess web app in Java EE 8, allowing for cross-network play and eventually implementing a miniMax algorithm to evaluate positions and provide a bot to play against.

The current roadmap is:

1) Implement game in simple java program (terminal read-out) to build fundamental classes
2) Build GUI
3) Convert into web app using Java EE
4) Use WebSocket to communicate moves between two clients
5) Implement miniMax algorithm
6) Automate testing
7) Wrap in a Docker container for ease of deployment
