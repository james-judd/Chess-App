WORK IN PROGRESS

The aim of this project is to build a chess web app in Java EE 8, allowing for cross-network play and eventually implementing a miniMax algorithm to evaluate positions and provide a bot to play against.

The current roadmap is:

1) Implement game in simple java program (terminal read-out) to build fundamental classes
2) Build GUI with Swing
3) Convert into web app with Webswing
4) Use WebSocket to communicate moves between two clients
5) Store game results in a MySQL database (local as it's free)
6) Implement miniMax algorithm
7) Automated testing
8) Wrap in a Docker container for ease of deployment
